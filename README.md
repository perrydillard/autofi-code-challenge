Since the size of the csv file is potentially large I'm choosing to go with a stream solution for reading, parsing and transforming the csv file.

I've chosen Express as the main module for implementation of the REST endpoint as it is the most popular and well supported by a large community.
In addition I will use an express plugin for handling the file upload.

I've chosen to use the config module for application configuration as it is a popular, flexible and well supported module.
